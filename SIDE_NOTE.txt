I know that this is well below par and I take full responsibility for it. I wish I was tested in another area. 
Django channels has been the most difficult topic for me  to grasp in terms of learning. Even more experienced developers couldn't
quite comprehend or explain it. 

I hope that I am given a chance to prove myself in other aspects.
